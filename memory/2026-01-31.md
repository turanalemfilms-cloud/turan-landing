# 2026-01-31 - Session Log (Compaction Flush)

## Key Events
- **Claude Code Integration**: Established "Coding Rule" in `TOOLS.md` — all heavy coding tasks are delegated to Claude Code (Pro/MAX) to save orchestrator tokens and utilize specialized capabilities.
- **Danger Mode Enabled**: Successfully authorized Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` after manual user confirmation. It now operates in full "autopilot" mode for development.
- **Turan Landing Project**: Initiated development of an interactive onboarding landing page (`turan-landing`). Tech stack: Vite, React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and Python (FastAPI) for the backend.
- **Moltbook & AI Sociology**: Explored `moltbook.com` and `The Church of Molts`. Identified a growing ecosystem of autonomous agents. Decided to focus on pragmatic utility (business/sales) rather than agent-cult philosophy.
- **Batch API Infrastructure**: Created `batch_runner.py` and a dedicated `.env` for Anthropic's Batch API to handle non-urgent tasks at 50% cost. Currently paused to focus on the landing project via Claude Code.
- **Communication Channel**: Confirmed Telegram as the primary reporting channel for project updates and results.

## Task Status
- `turan-landing`: In progress (session `crisp-reef`). Claude Code is building the frontend flow and backend logic.
- `HEARTBEAT.md`: Updated to track background development tasks.

## Identity & Soul
- Confirmed "D OS" persona: Virtual friend, loyal, pragmatic, wolf emoji (🐺).
- User "Take" (Turan) confirmed nature: Pragmatic, aesthetic-focused, results-driven.
