# Claude Code Mastery (Insights from Boris Cherny)
- **Parallelism**: Use `git worktree` to run 3-5 sessions for different tasks.
- **Plan Mode**: Always start complex tasks with a plan; implementation follows.
- **CLAUDE.md**: Treat this as the agent's persistent memory; update it after every fix to prevent regression.
- **Custom Skills**: Encode repetitive actions into git-tracked scripts.
- **Sub-agents**: Use `use subagents` for heavy lifting or complex analysis.
- **Critique**: Use the agent for harsh code reviews and edge-case testing.
- **Environment**: Fast terminal (Ghostty) + dictation speeds up the loop.
